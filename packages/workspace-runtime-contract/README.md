# Paseo command workspace runtime contract v2

Implement this contract to add a trusted workspace runtime without importing Paseo server code. Use the schemas and types from `@getpaseo/workspace-runtime-contract`; the tested byte examples are in [`examples/v2.json`](examples/v2.json).

The command-runtime protocol and workspace-helper protocol have independent version fields. A
Paseo release pins compatible versions of this package and `@getpaseo/workspace-helper`, then
verifies both `describe` responses. Runtime packages depend on both exact compatible versions and
bundle the official helper bin. Runtime authors do not reimplement its protocol.

## Commands

Your configured command receives one operation:

```text
describe
create --workspace-id <id>
inspect --workspace-id <id>
exec --workspace-id <id>
signal --workspace-id <id> --exec-id <id> --signal <signal>
pause --workspace-id <id>
resume --workspace-id <id>
destroy --workspace-id <id>
reconcile
```

`describe` writes `CommandRuntimeDescribeResponse` JSON to stdout. Lifecycle commands read one `CommandRuntimeLifecycleRequest` JSON value from stdin and write one `CommandRuntimeLifecycleResponse` JSON value to stdout. `create` and `resume` return `state`; `inspect` returns `inspection`; `pause`, `destroy`, and `reconcile` return `ok`. Diagnostics go to stderr. A non-zero wrapper exit means the operation failed.

Paseo sends options from trusted daemon configuration and a stable `runtimeInstanceId` for shared-resource ownership. Runtime implementations decide how that opaque instance token maps to their resource system. Secrets never belong in argv or temporary request files. The runtime must reject any `protocolVersion` other than `2` with a clear stderr diagnostic and non-zero exit. Every public v2 object schema is strict at every nested object boundary, so unknown keys fail instead of being stripped. Extensibility belongs only in the explicit `options`, workload `env`, and lifecycle-environment maps. The optional create `purpose: "discovery"` field marks a short-lived environment-discovery workspace without naming the higher-level consumer. Every `create` response must set `materializedFreshContent`: `true` only when that call created fresh workspace content/resources on which repo setup is permitted, and `false` when it adopted or reused existing content. `resume` state responses omit it.

`project.source` is either a directory visible to the runtime wrapper or a Git URL plus a required revision string and optional subdirectory. An empty Git revision selects the remote's default state. Paseo derives this source before invoking the runtime; `placement.cwd` never overrides it. A `discovery` create must expose the same runtime environment as a user workspace but must not execute repository setup. The checked-in JSON example uses this purpose so wrappers can lock its exact bytes.

A runtime owns the meaning of its `options`. Keep runtime-specific mount, container, VM, or supervisor authority out of lifecycle state and placement.

## Exec file descriptors

The workload owns fd 0, 1, and 2. Preserve their normal stdin, stdout, stderr, EOF, exit-code, and signal behavior.

Paseo writes a single newline-terminated `spawn` envelope to fd 3. For pipes, it then closes fd 3. For PTY, fd 3 stays open and carries newline-delimited `resize` and `signal` controls. Validate a resize before changing PTY state; reject an invalid frame without launching, resizing, or signaling anything. Acknowledge every accepted resize on fd 4 with the same id before consuming following workload input.

fd 4 carries newline-delimited process events for both modes. Its lifecycle is exactly `started` -> `eof` -> `exit`. Send `started` after the execution identity can be signaled; Paseo holds early signals until then. A PTY may send `resized` acknowledgements only after `started` and before `eof`; pipes may never send them. Duplicate, out-of-order, wrong-mode, or post-`exit` events are fatal. Close fd 4 after the single authoritative `exit`. An `error` event fails the process. A frame may arrive in partial chunks, but every frame must end in a newline. Malformed frames, a partial frame at EOF, and wrapper exit without the complete lifecycle are fatal. Paseo rejects a protocol failure only after bounded cleanup of that exact execution. PTY output remains raw workload bytes on fd 1. Closing fd 3 is the PTY control EOF; it is not another JSON control frame.

The authoritative fd 4 `exit` preserves the workload code or terminating signal; the wrapper mirrors it when possible. Forward `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGHUP` received by the wrapper to the workload process group. The separate `signal` command is the bounded cleanup path for `SIGKILL` and wrapper failure. It is idempotent, identifies only the live workload owned by `workspace-id` plus the opaque `exec-id`, and returns only after that workload is gone. Before authoritative `started`, a missing identity is not ready and must fail; after authoritative completion it is already clean. Never reuse an execution identity.

## Lifecycle and ownership

`workspaceId` is the reconciliation and ownership key. `create`, `pause`, `resume`, and `destroy` are idempotent. `inspect` is authoritative after either process restarts. `spawn` fails unless inspection is `ready`. `pause` preserves workspace state; `destroy` removes only resources owned by that workspace. `reconcile` may remove orphaned owned resources and must reject ownership mismatches.

Paseo addresses only `workspaceId`. The runtime keeps physical placement private and validates the optional workspace-relative `cwd` once, including traversal and symlink escapes; omission means workspace root. It executes `argv` directly, never as an implicit shell string, with exactly the provided workload environment. Do not inherit the wrapper or daemon environment. Lifecycle state contains no root, revision, execution domain, container name, or supervisor state. Public placement is descriptive compatibility data only: `cwd` is never execution authority.

Every runtime must provide the compatible `paseo-workspace-helper` executable on its workload `PATH`. Paseo launches it as an ordinary workload with purpose `workspace-helper`, already rooted at the private workspace placement. The helper receives only relative `--path` values and uses its process cwd (`.`) as confinement authority; it has no `--root` option. Runtime authors do not implement file, watch, Git, provider, script, or agent APIs: the helper handles structured files and watching, while Paseo runs Git, providers, and scripts through `exec`.

`describe` includes `requirements.daemonAuthentication`. Paseo refuses a runtime that requires
authentication when daemon authentication is disabled. Placement may include `hostVisiblePath`
for host editor integration; it is descriptive and never execution authority.

## Compatibility

Version 2 targets macOS/Linux hosts and POSIX runtime environments. Unknown v2 fields are rejected; future fields require a new protocol version. A semantic change to framing, fd ownership, lifecycle, or cleanup also increments the protocol version. Paseo fails closed on a version mismatch; it never falls back to host execution.

The private `@getpaseo/fixture-workspace-runtime` package is the executable contract fixture. It records the validated create input, can copy a directory source into owned storage, exposes deterministic failure and placement options, and runs workloads through both pipe and PTY framing. It is test infrastructure, not a production runtime or a second schema owner; all validation comes from this package's exported schemas.
