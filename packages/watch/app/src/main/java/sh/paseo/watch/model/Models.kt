/**
 * Watch-side view of Paseo's Project -> Workspace -> Agent session hierarchy.
 *
 * These are display models, not wire types. The phone app owns the daemon
 * connection and flattens its snapshot into these before pushing them over the
 * Wearable Data Layer, so the watch never has to know about timelines,
 * providers config, or git state.
 *
 * Terminology follows docs/glossary.md exactly: a Workspace is one cwd on one
 * daemon belonging to exactly one Project, and an Agent session is one running
 * instance of an agent inside a workspace. Worktree-backed workspaces carry the
 * mnemonic names (`jubilant-wombat`), so those are workspace labels — never
 * agent labels.
