/**
 * Paseo context for a Live Voice call.
 *
 * The realtime model is a conversational front end, not a coding agent. The call
 * is daemon-global and runs on a hidden host session the daemon spawns for it,
 * in a neutral directory rather than any of the user's projects. That host
 * session has only Paseo's MCP routing tools injected (see
 * `withRuntimePaseoMcpServer`). They send ordinary Paseo tool calls through the
 * owning client to whichever connected host the user chooses. So the voice
 * model needs to know that Paseo exists, how to select a host safely, and what
 * is running on the host that placed the call.
 *
 * It also needs the exact names of the tools it will reach for. Discovering them
 * costs a model turn each, and the user hears silence for every one.
 *
 * Two levers, both set on `thread/realtime/start`:
 *   - `prompt` replaces the voice model's entire system prompt.
 *   - `initialItems` seeds the conversation with a state snapshot (v3 only).
 * We also pass `includeStartupContext: false` so codex's own synthesized
 * context doesn't compete with this one.
 *
 * Caveat: a user's `experimental_realtime_ws_backend_prompt` in their codex
 * config takes precedence over `prompt`. That ordering lives in codex, so a user
 * who sets it opts out of the Paseo prompt.
