 * `wrapSessionProvider` re-declares the session surface by hand, so anything it forgets

 * That is not a type error, because the optional methods are optional.
 *
 * This is how `listMcpServers` went missing: the panel appeared for a Cursor agent, then
 * removed itself the moment it asked, because the wrapper had swallowed the method and
 * the daemon read that as "this provider cannot report".
