/**
 * Codex's Live Voice hosting profile — the adapter that maps codex specifics
 * onto the coordinator's neutral seam. Everything codex-flavored about hosting
 * a call belongs here, not in `server/live-voice/`.
 *
 * Model: codex resolves an unknown model id to its own default, so an older
 * codex still hosts calls with a stale default here.
 *
 * Do not expect much latency from the model choice. Measured against codex's
 * own rollouts (see docs/architecture.md), a median action costs ~13s, of which
 * ~9.5s is the realtime model deciding plus codex's handoff, ~2.4s is the turn
 * that actually emits the tool call, and ~20ms is Paseo. That emitting turn
 * runs on a codex *subagent* thread pinned by codex to its own model and
 * effort, not to anything set here. The lever that moves the number is making
 * fewer calls.
 *
 * Known gap: codex reports the host thread at effort `high` even when
 * `thinkingOptionId` says otherwise, so the thinking half of this pin is not
 * reaching the provider. Worth chasing only if host-thread turns turn out to
 * dominate that 9.5s window.
 *
 * Context limits: codex enforces 128 items and 8,192 estimated tokens per item
 * and in total on `thread/realtime/start`, counting 4 bytes per token. The
 * budget stays well under: the snapshot competes with the user's actual
 * conversation for attention, and a rejected start costs the whole call.
 *
 * Caveat: a user's `experimental_realtime_ws_backend_prompt` in their codex
 * config takes precedence over the prompt this profile's host sends. That
 * ordering lives in codex, so a user who sets it opts out of the Paseo prompt.
