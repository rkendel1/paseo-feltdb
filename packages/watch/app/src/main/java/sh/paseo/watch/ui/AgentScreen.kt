/**
 * Agent detail: the conversation, and what you can do about it.
 *
 * The list reads like a chat log — oldest at the top, newest at the bottom, actions
 * below that — and it *opens* at the bottom. That ordering is the whole design: the
 * newest turn and the Reply button are what you get without touching the crown, and
 * the crown scrolls up into the backlog only when you want it. Anchoring at the top
 * instead would put the oldest turn under your eyes and the actions off-screen.
 *
 * Until a transcript arrives — and a phone too old to answer `requestTranscript`
 * never sends one — the screen falls back to the snapshot's one-line summary. That
 * is a normal state, not an error, so it gets no error treatment.
 *
 * Reply is the 52dp accent primary, and it *is* the composer: tapping it opens
 * speech recognition immediately. There used to be a screen in between offering a
 * choice of input method, which meant every spoken reply cost two taps and a screen
 * full of canned answers nobody wanted. Type and Stop are deliberately smaller and
 * muted — they are rarely what you came for, and on a wrist the cost of a mis-tap is
 * what sizes a button.
